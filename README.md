# Link opener Pragtical plugin

This is a [Pragtical](https://pragtical.dev/) plugin for opening links. Should work on [Lite-XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) too, but I think you may have to remove the contextmenu code.

## Installation

Navigate to the plugins folder (usually ~/.config/pragtical/plugins) and run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/irisdominguez/pragtical_link-opener_plugin link_opener
```

Alternatively the init.lua file can be renamed link_opener.lua and dropped in the plugins folder.

## Usage

Move the cursor to any link, and press `Ctrl + Enter` while on the link.

Alternatively, right click on any link and select `Open link` from the context menu, or `Ctrl + Alt + Left click` on any link.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
